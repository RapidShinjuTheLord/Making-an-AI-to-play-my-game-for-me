## Background 
When choosing a topic to learn more about, I began by brainstorming my general 
interests and developed ideas for some general learning and product goals that could connect to them in a mind map. I then narrowed those ideas down into 3 main topic ideas that I wanted to explore: Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Game Development, but after some general research into each topic, I decided that a specific field of Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning would be the perfect topic for my personal project. Reinforcement learning is a specific type of AI that learns through interaction with a simulated environment.

There were a few reasons that this type of AI was exciting to me: firstly, playing 
computer games is quite a significant hobby of mine, so a few years ago when one of my favorite games, Starcraft, became the basis for Google DeepMind’s reinforcement learning project and news of the team working on developing an AI that could go toe to toe with the game’s best players spread like wildfire amongst Starcraft’s online communities, my imagination became enamored with that prospect (Alphastar: Mastering the Real-Time Strategy Game).

## Product Goal
To accomplish my learning goal, I needed to decide on a product goal that would allow 
me to exercise and apply the skills that I had learned in a practical setting. Taking inspiration from those of youtube channels as well as the work done by DeepMind on AlphaStar as well as AlphaZero: I decided that for my product, I wanted to program an original game, along with an AI agent that is able to play said game (Alphastar: Mastering the Real-Time Strategy Game; Alphazero: Shedding New Light on Chess, Shogi and Go). The reason that I wanted to use an original game as opposed to simply learning how to build an AI on a pre-existing game is because I wanted my game to have a greater sense of originality. While I could have chosen to build an AI that would excel at ‘flappy bird’ or ‘snake’ or ‘dino jump’, these games, due to their fame and simplicity, have already been beaten with AI time and time again by programmers and scientists far more experienced than I, so I didn’t want my final product to be redundant in that sense.

## Research
A major informational source was a myriad of online articles, which would therefore be largely text-based, digital collections of information that tended to focus on the theoretical aspects of RL. Through these article sources, I learnt a lot of important information about Q- values, state and action pairs, reward functions, markov-decision processes, neural networks as well as policy-updating mathematical functions. Another crucial informational source was a digital copy of an in-depth Reinforcement Learning textbook by Richard S. Sutton, and Andrew  G. Barto. This book goes really in-depth concerning the rigorous mathematical definitions, abstract concepts and theoretical technicalities, which not only helped me to achieve my learning goal, but also gave me points of inspiration and guidance when implementing the agent for my product. While I admittedly did not have the time to read all 17 chapters, the first few chapters were of great help nonetheless. Youtube tutorials became of great help when learning how to actually program a reinforcement learning algorithm to a given problem (sentdex). 
This is because video sources are much easier to follow alongside with, and great 
sources will fully explain what they are doing as they type code, and the level at which they explained concepts such as syntax and methods within libraries were at a perfect level for me to fully understand and be able to make a product of my own afterward. Finally, I found online forum posts to be an excellent source of information for really specific issues and problems with learning the practical implementations of reinforcement learning. While other sources are far more solidly verifiable in their information and are often made by more established experts and teachers, they are often limited in that they can’t resolve super specific error messages or library conflicts in my program, which online forums, particularly those focused on AI, are often great at answering.
